# Perrig-Song-Randomart

This package provides a (browser side) js module to generate randomart images
based on Perrig and Song's 1999 paper ["Hash Visualization: a New Technique to
improve Real-World Security"](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/papers/randomart.pdf).
It supports the basic grammar given by Perrig and Song, as well as a restricted
subset of [Tsoding's](https://github.com/tsoding) 
[extended grammar](https://github.com/tsoding/randomart/blob/main/grammar.bnf) 
from his [C implementation](https://github.com/tsoding/randomart).
